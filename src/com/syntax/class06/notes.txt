Selenium Class 6

Alerts:
Alert is a pop-up message, Alert takes a complete focus of our main page that we are working on.
We can not proceed until its handled.

3 Types of Alerts:
1.web based alerts/html alerts - we can simply inspect and perform needed actions
2.Javascript alerts/browser alerts - we can handle these alerts by using switchTo method
                                     we cannot inspect any of javascript alerts
3.Windows based alerts - we cannot handle with Selenium

Types of JS alerts:
1.Simple alert   - click ok
2.Confirmation alert - either cancel or click ok
3.prompt alert - enter text and then click ok

To handle JS alerts we only have 4 methods:
1. accept() - click ok
2. dismiss() - click cancel
3. getText()
4. sendKeys()
