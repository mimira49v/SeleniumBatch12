Selenium Class 3

why do we need Xpath and Css Selector?
    Developers will not provide all the locators in html
    by using xpath and css we can identify elements with any given attributes

What is an Xpath?
    Xpath is like a query language which helps us to identify elements
    uniquely on the web page

Types of Xpath :
    Absolute Xpath - will start from the starting note of the html
                     it always starts with single slash (/)
                     e.g. /html/body/div/div/div

    Relative Xpath - starts from any node in the html
                     it always starts with double slash //

Syntax for relative xpath:
//tagName[@attribute = 'attribute value']

Example: //input[@id ='email']

Identifying elements by its text:
//TagName[text()='text']
//h2[text()='Connect with friends and the world around you on Facebook.']

Identifying elements by using contains method
//TagName[contains(@attribute, 'partial attribute value')]

Starts-with will identify the element with partial starting value
//TagName[starts-with(@attribute,'partial starting attribute')]

//button[starts-with(@data-testid, 'royal')]

ends-with was used in xpath 1.0, we are using 2.0 and this method is not available

<div> division
<img> image
<h>   header
<li>  list
<ul>  unordered list
<ol>  ordered list
<br>  breaking line

Advanced Xpath
is based on parent and child, sibling relationship

Identifying elements by following sibling
//TagName[@attribute = 'attribute value']/following-sibling::tagName

when we are going through sibling
//input[@id = 'calFromDate']/following-sibling::img

identifying elements by preceding siblings
//TagName[@attribute = 'attribute value']/preceding-sibling ::tagName
//span[text() = '& Orders']/preceding-sibling::span

identifying elements by parents
//TagName[@attribute = 'attribute value']/parent ::parentTagName
//span[text()= '& Orders']/parent::a

identifying an element by its ancestor
//TagName[@attribute= 'attribute value']/ancestor ::ancestorTagName
//input[@id = 'email']/ancestor::form

Identifying element by index
(//img[@class ='ui-datepicker-trigger'])[2]
