Locator
is an address or a position of a web element on the web page
is used to locate or identify webElements on the web page
8 locators:
- ID
- Name
- Tag Name
- Xpath
- LinkText
- PartialLinkText
- CSS selector

HTML Scripting meeting
Purple -- tags || button, input, div
brown -- attribute || name, class, id
blue -- attribute value||

- Developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements
- some locators may have duplicate values in different modes
- If 2 or more elements have same attributes and attribute values, selenium will only interact with the first
element that it locates
- Some locators may not be applicable for the element we are looking for

"a" tag is also called an anchor tag

If 2 or more elements have same attributes and attribute values,
selenium will only interact with the first element it locates
